omsciq,the weekly dd globale online glbe the uncut diamond,overview what is exactly is globale they are a company that integrates with ecommerce platforms to remove complexity with international transactions and provide localized solutions that improve the online shopping experience the core of the services revolve around the following from the s ampxb gt‚Äúthe vast capabilities of our endtoend platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages marketadjusted pricing payment options tailored to local market preferences compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes shipping services aftersales support and returns management these elements are unified under the globale platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the crossborder opportunity‚Äù ampxb they are the ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù of making ecommerce international their vast network of apis allow a customer to simply integrate their platform and seamlessly begin selling across different borders and languages heres what they do currently globale supports local messaging in over languages purchases in over currencies accepts over payment methods a multitude of competitivelypriced shipping options ampxb business model globale generates revenues by charging a fee ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù for the integration of their platform into a merchants services service fees are highly variable based on transaction volume destination markets level of customer service provided etc and are generated as a percentage of the gross merchandise value ‚Äúgmv‚Äù that flows through the platform globale mandatorily bundles certain components of their integrated platform solutions that they believe are essential for achieving improved sales conversions from international traffic however their fulfillment services are offered on an optional basis and merchants can choose to utilize those services or cancel at any time think of it as bundling service a and b to have the greatest effect while offering service c as an addon component service fees make up for approximately of revenue while fulfillment services are currently accounting for roughly ampxb partnerships amp why they use globale globale has formed many key technological as well as service partnerships these thirdparty ecommerce platforms include salesforce commerce cloud shopify bigcommerce magento commerce sap woocommerce prestashop and others ampxb what they do for merchants some of the key benefits they provide for merchants are increased sales conversions converting international traffic offloading complexities handling local pricing payment collection import duties fraud etc reduction of risk reduce legal complexity manage import duties and taxes handle compliance enabling growth to new markets allowing merchants flexibility to expand to crossborder opportunities all while emphasizing merchant branding the customer always faces the digital storefront and never leaves the brand page to checkout ampxb what they do for shoppers globales goal is to offer a frictionless shopping journey regardless of the origin of the customer this means localized languages repricing in local currencies handling crossborder payments accurately preprice import duties and taxes and include them in the final cost of the product delivery using an extensive network of over shipping carriers they are able to offer multiple shipping modes at attractive rates aftersale support and returns merchants integrating globale into their platform generally experience a significantly higher international traffic conversion rate often exceeding the globale platform removes many complexities involved with international expansion they already have more than merchants from small companies to globallyrecognized retailers on the platform across various diversified verticals ampxb shopify deal as mentioned above one of globale most lucrative partners lies with shopify making them the exclusive thirdparty and crossborder solution across the large network of shopify merchants shopify knows what kind of business that will bring for globale and thus shopify has bought million shares and acquired a stake in the company as shopify grows globale grows and shopify knows this hence the stake in a company that reflects their own revenues by proxy ampxb tam amp cagr first came the transition to domestic ecommerce as well as sourcing and reselling products from china aka dropshipping next is going to be the transition of global ecommerce and crossborder sales according to this page research by globenewswire the global crossborder bc ecommerce market was billion in and expected to grow at a cagr of through where it will become a trillion market ampxb globales smart insights one of the companys strengths lies within sophisticated ‚Äúsmart insights‚Äù they use to scale their applications smart insights is a ‚Äúbig data‚Äù network that uses various metrics such as country pricepoint and shopper behaviors allowing globale to provide highlyoptimized experience for shoppers this ends up driving increased conversion rates and revenues for the merchant and a better overall experience for the shopper the company has noted by integrating bigdata into their platform they can experience ‚Äúeconomies of scale‚Äù as well as ‚Äúeconomies of skill‚Äù enabling them to optimize merchants crossborder sales these insights are continuously expanding as they collect additional data points along the purchasing journey ampxb competitive advantage amp growth opportunities what seems to be becoming more of a trend since and even more so now in are corporations use of big data im not talking about basic user data such as age gender location but more on the lines of vastly large information networks these networks can utilize things such as time spent on page scrolls and clicks all in one massive database globale differentiates themselves through their main data asset ‚Äúsmart insights‚Äù that informs them on certain decisions and is able to optimize how merchants sell their product across different borders they integrate this data network into a flywheel effect for example their current analytics drives more sales to merchants which then feeds new data back into the system which then allows for higher optimization and better conversions they feed into each other back and forth getting smarter with each website visitor and purchase this aligns perfectly for their products ‚Äúnet dollar retention rate‚Äù of and in and respectively ampxb globale attributes much of their growth to being a first mover and doing it right in the crossborder ecommerce space their success has been accelerated by several key factors such as accelerated shift towards ecommerce outpacing traditional retail crossborder ecommerce growing faster than domestic ecommerce their merchants strategic focus on dc sales maintaining relationship with shoppers globally the complexity and limitations of leaving the merchant responsible for implementing what globale offers this doesnt come down to just a cost but also timeintensive as well as being difficult to maintain and scale covid tailwinds ampxb as a result of the above and other market factors the crossborders ecommerce market is expected to continue the surge in growth i previously mentioned the forecast in tam however forrester a research company also expects the crossborder ecommerce markets to reach $ billion by globale has several opportunities to expand on existing channels and capture new markets this can be done with growth through existing portfolio of merchants and strengthening relationships acquiring new merchants in existing geographies expanding in new geographies that they dont have exposure to continue to expand and innovate their platform continue to develop strategic partnerships with key brands and players ampxb risks many of globales risks fall under the category of general business risks some of these include retaining old merchants and attracting new ones failing to enhance the platform as well as successfully competing against new and existing competition failing to manage growth pricing pressures from competition and being highly dependent on crossborder regulations sales and operations ampxb revenues scale amp profitability in fy globale helped process million orders for their merchants generating $ million their gross merchandise value gmv also grew to million for the same period other impressive metrics were their net dollar retention rate and gross profit as of revenue both of which continue to climb at and respectively stellar some key growth metrics the company has seen in and although the company has recently turned a profit while growing topline revenue and gmv at a high pace the company suggested that shortterm profitability might be sacrificed due to the expansions they are making to cover larger markets as noted from the s ampxb gt‚Äúwe expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel expand into new geographies expand our partnerships operations and infrastructure continue to enhance our platform develop and expand its features integrations and capabilities expand and improve our service offering and increase our spending on sales and marketing we intend to continue to build and enhance our platform through internal research and development and we may also selectively pursue acquisitions‚Äù ampxb lets take a quick peak at their consolidated statement of operations note the revenue growth and total operating expenses that decrease as a percentage of total revenue as revenues increase almost doubles yoy valuation looking at glbes valuation it is clear that you pay a premium when owning this company ampxb the good glbe is growing revenue at yoy gross margins are improving while the company continues to scale many tech and services partnerships they can piggy back on ampxb the bad consistent profitability could be years away as the company is investing heavily into their own expansion of current and new markets glbe is currently trading at roughly x price to sales and forward pe ampxb up for debate globale has almost no longterm debt but current liabilities are stacking up while the company is not generating much fcf i wouldnt expect them to be generating this much fcf this early in the game after their ipo lockup expiration on august ampxb final thoughts in my opinion globale is top of the class when it comes to their business they are growing extremely fast while improving margins and this is the premium you would pay versus investing in a ‚Äústable‚Äù company generating tons of fcf but not much growth due to the nature of being a highgrowth stock there will naturally be more volatility around the trade while its currently trading at x pricesales i am more likely to shy away from entering a new position we could see this stock swing to x ps and potentially enter on the dips this is somewhat of a chicken or the egg situation because there might not be any dips to buy with this kind of growth for example at current growth rates yoy if stock price is maintained it would only be trading at less than half its pricesales valuation only one year from now this is definitely a stock to monitor closely if you are wanting to find the right entry point for a longterm hold ampxb tldr globale is an ‚Äúenabler‚Äù that allows ecommerce and digital stores to seamlessly integrate international transactions they deal with tasks from translations currency repricing international shipping amp returns compliance amp tax regulations etc glbe integrates their proprietary ‚Äúsmart insights‚Äù application that analyses customer shopping and transaction data to continuously improve on sales conversions the feedback loop is always learning as it collects more and more data along each customers purchase journey glbe is trading at a rich valuation given their total revenue was $ million in however they are growing topline revenues and gross merchandise value gmv over yoy shopify holds a stake in globale as glbe facilitates a large amount of transactions on the shopify network as shopify grows glbe grows glbe is growing through many tailwinds such as those from covid lockdowns and accelerated shift toward ecommerce outpacing traditional retail theyve got an opportunity to expand into more international regions strengthen relationships with existing merchants while continuing to expand and improve their platform,1,2021-07-18 08:12:01

no links pretty charts or colors one pic of a bunch of numbers that didnt format out well as text well see what happens i added a rocket emoji to this earlier this week and got banned for hours as i dont know whats gonna set off the powers that be i decided to go with a wall of text so apologies in advance if you want pretty colors save some of your snack crayons to draw on your own screens ampxb ampxb ampxb ive written about himax himx before other folks as well have posted some dd on them and i wont repeat it all here as theres a lot of info ampxb ampxb that said a tiny sampling of background ampxb ampxb one of their biggest revenue sources is from ics for flat panel screens ampxb ampxb ampxb they also make lcos displays famously used in google glass a technology which also has the added benefit of being a main component in upandcoming lidar systems for autonomous vehicles and they also look to be poised to take off with their flat panel tech for the automotive and trucking industry ampxb ampxb ampxb suffice to say they make stuff that makes your tech toys more fun ampxb ampxb ampxb lots of things in their favor but two that stand out are their negligible debt and the fact that the brothers jordan and biingseng wu secured fab time before covid so they can make their goodies hence theyre gonna make money ampxb ampxb ampxb which leads me to ampxb ampxb ampxb dividend yup they pay out a dividend now that usually doesnt indicate rockets that will take us to the moon and beyond quickly but bear with me ampxb ampxb ampxb they paid out their dividend on monday july based on their income from it came out to around $ usa per share which closed on july at $ usa each ampxb ampxb ampxb here is why this is relevant ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb $ is approximately of $ this gives us numbers we can work with ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb maffs is hard but ive tried to write this in apeish so everyone can read and enjoy ampxb ampxb so lets dive in ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb now lets talk about the divvy for next year ampxb ampxb scenario i ampxb ampxb lets assume himx pays out a divvy at next year as they did this year ampxb ampxb lets also assume theyre on target for their second quarter projected estimate but lets go with the figure in the lowest possible range given so thats gonna be $ ampxb ampxb now lets also assume they have a shitty rest of the year and make absolutely no more money ampxb ampxb so the total amount made for quarter plus quarter is approximately $ ampxb ampxb ampxb this is the absolute minimum they can make for the year as of this writing and for the sake of our little exercise in scenario i its also gonna be the maximum ampxb ampxb lets project forward to dividend payout date in ampxb ampxb if the percentage remains the same of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in which is typically in late juneearly july calculated from a dividend payout of $ per share would give us a share price of around $ usa ampxb ampxb ampxb take a moment and let your smooth brain work on that one ampxb ampxb ampxb $ usa to $ usa in about one years time ampxb ampxb ampxb an increase of approximately ampxb ampxb ampxb now a share price less than $ would mean our percentage goes up because remember $ dividend payout is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant ampxb ampxb so lets say the share price stays completely flat and is $ usa on divvy payout day that would mean the percentage on the payout of $ would be approximately ampxb ampxb to reiterate if one were to purchase himx at $ around now and the price never moves up for a year in a years time one would earn a minimum of roi with no downside it does not go tits up ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb if the share price goes up our percentage return on the divvy goes down $ being the constant but our shares are worth more and we get a divvy payout again no downside no tits up ampxb ampxb ampxb if the share price goes down potential investors keeping tabs on himx have an ohshit moment realizing they can get in on some sweet sweet divvy action and start buying driving the price back up to our purchase price and quite probably above it again no downside no tits up ampxb ampxb ampxb as previously mentioned the heads of this joint secured fab time before covid so they can make their goodies that means theyre gonna make money for quarters and quarters of so the dollar figures for scenario i are unlikely ampxb so onward to ampxb ampxb ampxb scenario ii ampxb ampxb ampxb just for shits and giggles as they are gonna make more money than in scenario i lets say they clear $ combined for both quarters and average of $ usa per share for each quarter ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb that puts our total profit for the year at $ per share ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb again lets assume himx pays out a divvy at next year as they did this year ampxb ampxb ampxb if the dividend percentage remains the same of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in again which is typically in late juneearly july would be $ usa ampxb ampxb sip on your juice box eat a crayon and contemplate that for a moment ampxb ampxb scenario iii ampxb ampxb ampxb okay weve been using data based on this most recent payout while also looking at some extreme examples of data lets expand our data set and also start working with some reasonable numbers for next year to get what i feel will be much closer to reality when the divvy pays out in ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb all reported profit data ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb since ive calculated from through and weve got cash amounts for each year lets calculate the percentage of the payout based on the previous years eps ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb dunno about this perhaps a special dividend payout ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb now time for disclosure some data i do not have in front of me is the minimum percentage a publiclytraded taiwanese company must pay out for a dividend there are requirements for them to do a payout with some exceptions meeting some requirements capex for example which is why himx did not pay out a divvy in and as they had capex and met other requirements in both of those years but i dont think it has to be as can be seen above its been all over the map over the years as i dont know what the minimum would be and the laws did change in for scenario iii im going to use this allows himx to use of their profits for capex which i feel is reasonable ampxb ampxb also instead of for our divvy as a percentage of the share price ending on the payout date based on the average percentage after removing top and bottom outliers over the years were going to use ampxb ampxb ampxb finally well use nasdaqs quarterly earnings forecasts to fill in the blanks for the rest of the year using the low eps forecasts for quarters and i feel their projections are way too low but as theyre conservative and were bound to hit them well go with themthe brothers wu will be giving us better estimates for at least quarter come august those numbers give us a total eps for the year of at $ per share ampxb ampxb okay based on this data which i feel is in a completely reasonable and realistic range we have the following ampxb ampxb ampxb projecting forward to dividend payout date in if himx pays out a divvy at next year on a percentage which is of the share value then the price per share on the dividend payout date in which is typically in late juneearly july calculated from a dividend payout of $ per share of which is $ would give us a share price of approximately $ ampxb ampxb based off of the recent closing price of $ this represents an increase of approximately ampxb ampxb i feel this is an extremely realistic share price for the dividend payout date in approximately one year from now as the absolute minimum it should be based on the data provided ampxb ampxb ampxb additional thoughts ampxb ampxb most people as well as institutions might not be interested in a stock for a divvy payout but some might that return is far better than what a bank is giving on cds these days ampxb ampxb ampxb that said at around a return calculated from our historical data above institutional investors may start to sit up and take notice i feel based on the past performance is probably the sweet spot for the return and as a result will entice more institutional investment this will also stabilize the share price historically himx has been owned largely by individual investors with a fairly low percentage of institutional investment ampxb ampxb this is actually why the divvy is so important not as a dividend but as a way to help stabilize the share price ampxb reason as i wrote if the share price stays completely flat and is $ usa on divvy payout date that would mean the percentage on the payout of $ would be approximately again a share price less than that would mean our percentage goes up above because remember $ is for the sake of this exercise both the minimum and a constant ampxb so if youre an institution and you wantneed a place to park large amounts of cash something thats giving a return on investment of is fantastic ergo institutions may be most interested in buying up himx thus driving the price back upwards and overall keeping it afloat and quite possibly preventing it from taking the massive dips it has in the past not to say it wont whipsaw again in the future but it may just not be quite as violent as it has in the past ampxb ampxb ampxb while i feel the price per share will reach approximately $ by dividend payout date in it by no means is relegated to reaching that price or higher by next year ampxb in fact if history is any indication even with more institutional investment i suspect we may see wild price swings for the share price of $himx between now and next years dividend payout ampxb now as indicated these might be tempered somewhat by the institutional purchases or individuals buying really large blocks of $himx as described previously said purchases essentially stabilizing the price and preventing it from dropping significantly below its current price point that said an example of the possible upcoming action might be to see it run up to say $ then drop back down to around $ and finally stabilizing at $ by divvy payout day ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb we havent even begun to look at options yet if youre interested in options when they become available id recommend looking at junejuly leaps buying calls or possibly selling puts ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb thats only for the next year as himx has more design wins and their newest bleedingedge technologies are adopted by more and more companies coupled with the current chip shortage that will last probably into at least they are poised to print for quite a few years to come ampxb ampxb recent article posted on digitimes entitled chipmos chipbond may further raise backend quotes in h stated the following ampxb backend houses chipmos technologies and chipbond technology are expected to raise again their backend service quotes later in the second half of as robust demand for caruse display driver ics ddi and nor flash chips continues to fill their factory capacities according to industry sources ampxb taiwans ddi vendors including novatek microelectroncis and himax technologies are set to ramp up shipments of both lcd and oled automotive ddi chips in the third quarter as they have just passed strict client validations after two years of deployments in such chips the sources said and they mainly rely on chipmos and chipbond for testing and packaging services the sources said ampxb both backend houses are expected to sustain full capacity utilization throughout and will surely raise their service quotes later in the year amid their increasingly tight capacity supply the sources noted their additional highend testing capacities for ddi chips and memory chips have been fully booked soon after they began purchasing new testing machines the sources continued ampxb translation the tendies are gonna shower down like manna from heaven ampxb finally himx closed friday july at $ thats a discount from monday trade accordingly ampxb easiest thing to do right now is simply buy shares and hodl get your divvy next year and if you want to sell do so and pay longterm capital gains instead of short term ampxb tendietown my fellow apes ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb ampxb tldr ampxb ampxb ampxb maffs is hard so lets just say himx is gonna go to the moon and beyond over the next few years and pay you a divvy while it does so buy and hodl and get a bucket of tendies either in the form of divvy or a stock price that provides roi at the very least or greater probably much much more and gives you a divvy ampxb

on00fy,market perspective recent trends and performance in charts,since the volatility in midlate may ive been generally bullish on the market it seemed that nothing could accelerate meaningful downside move and this i think was further proven with the postfomc reaction of a small stumble and then right back up and while ive continued to be bullish more recently i have been looking at and discussing metrics and commentary around market breadth and the authenticity of this latest move to aths lets look at some charts to build context spy vs rsp y spy vs mahp y spy vs sfi y in the first chart we compare the performance of the spy to the rsp the latter being the equalweight sampp index we can see that while the spy has bounced to new highs from the midjune low the rsp has traded largely sideways at first this may look similar to previous patterns in the chart where the performance has diverged but this is in fact a divergence of direction one going up and the other sideways this is still a nascent pattern in my opinion but a worrying sign if this continues the second chart shows the spy vs the percentage of sampp stocks making new alltimehighs the latter of which continues to hover in a range around for example on friday only of sampp stocks closed at aths our last chart shows the the spy vs the sfi the percentage of sampp stocks above their dma at close on any given day what this might tell us is that this recent rally has been narrow in other words lacking broad participation and fueled by a few select stocks dragging the index higher thats generally not considered a healthy move and can be indicative of a stallout or perhaps a setup to some downside charts sector compare ytd so while the indices have moved higher as of late there doesnt seem to be a particular sector thats been leading the way and in fact it seems like weve had more downside than upside moves sectorwise through the last few weeks ampxb spy y qqq y iwm y lets also take a look at the rsp and arkk charts rsp y arkk y takeaways arkk representative of the growth trade seemed like it had taken a turn for the better but then stalled out around the mark which seems to be overhead resistance its since given back a good bit and with it now below its dma i wonder if well continue to see further downside here i think the rsp here tells us a lot its been in a tight range for awhile now and failed to make new highs in concert with the spy which again is a real indicator that a handful of stocks are dragging the index higher iwm continues to be rangebound but im getting the feeling we could test the lower end of that around the area soon given recent performance spy and qqq dont look terrible especially with last weeks stumbles cooling off rsi but as ive discussed here the credibility of this rally is in doubt as mentioned above its hard to see any clear leader here in terms of a trade but also hard to see a meaningful pullback happening either perhaps this earnings season will be the catalyst for some welldefined actiondirection going forward i think at a highlevel i buy in to this idea that were in a ‚Äúphase two‚Äù of this bull market where phase one has aggressively pulled forward valuations and now companies must prove their stocks worth this likely means a more challenging environment where we trade sideways at the index level and investors must find alpha at the individual stock level and i think this has really been the case since february or march this year what ive been reading variant perception phases of a bull market ft ‚Äòstrange bond reaction to us inflation data puzzles investors bonus charts uber y i think uber has been breaking down for awhile and this setup looks like it could yield further downside as weve broken below this lower trendline the dmas have turned down under the dma‚Ä¶ it just doesnt look great,1,2021-07-18 14:38:48

on10do,sunday watchlist soft ta xela aehr spce verb atos sgoc rcat negg clov mrin blin,whats up fellow retards will add images after dumb autom doesnt delete i am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are im a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations relative volatility index and volume on a month and year time frame to determine my buysell areas on stocks no matter whether i am swing trading or trading intraday easy breakdown of statistical standard deviations of a stocks price range over a given time frame is within statistical standard deviation blue lines of its averageregression trend middle line within two deviations first upper and lower purple lines and within deviations second upper and lower purple lines known as the rule most importantly these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels with deviations once crossed becoming either the new resistance or new support level i generally use this to find stocks that are trading above deviations to shortbuy puts or at deviations to buy callsstock as these areas represent only of the price action over a given time period and statistically theres a chance the price will drop back below or climb back above deviations respectively i did this with amazon puts recently otherwise i mostly trade off deviation support and ride volume up to next deviation resistance level before exiting the position which is what these tas will be about see my previous sofi and amc and amzn nvda etc tas if you want examples of how this strategy works i dont have all damn night so lets get into my personal price targets on these stocks which i will be playing monday if the support setups are reached these will be named under the stock ticker and its chart and my upside target at which ill theoretically be exiting along with a general ta of what price action we might see deviation supportresistance lines will be drawn on the one year and month charts and the same deviation lines will be visible on the intraday chart posted next to the daily and hour daily year hour month chart these charts are already zoomed in to provide more detail on the current price action whats important is the deviation lines drawn from long term statistical trends which act as true supportresistance relative to the current price format will be longterm charts first zoomed image of one yearmonth then the intraday chart to the right remember blue lines deviation and first purple lines second purple lines deviations all acting as supportresistance levels relative to price after mondays trading is over see where the prices of these stocks found support and resistance guarantee be the deviation levels you see on the one year and month charts below you dont even need my explanation just look at the first image ive drawn red lines at deviation levels on both longterm and intraday charts for you xela one yearmonth and intraday xela has the last few days consistently held deviation support on the month chart and held through afterhours trading friday of $ i will only be entering it if its holding the $ deviation level so i can ride it up to our next deviation resistance of $ on one year chart before exiting there is also a bounce trade to be played at the $ deviation on the one year chart aehr one yearmonth and intraday aehrs moves would be similar to xela for me it tested month dev support on month chart early friday then broke up to dev resistance levels of on one year and month chart i bought in at premarket and rode the move up and exited ill pretty much be looking for it to repeat this move monday should it hold support and hold till the deviation resistance levels should it crack these levels premarket i

entering a position around this price point and exiting it at deviations on one year chart around $ remember deviation support lines be broken the next deviation is support and the deviation it

on2p1e,$xela is actually also a good company,the digital era is in full bloom with new technologies creating possibilities and markets once not thought possible companies across all industries are moving as fast as they can to replace their old legacy systems with new ones that will help them reduce spending increase efficiency and give them the advantage they need to outdo competitors although companies know they need to adapt to these new technologies many of them dont know where to begin or how to implement them into operations the business process automation market is based around helping companies make this transition through implementing a series of robotic automation solutions intended to replace repetitive and predefined human tasks the need for business process automation or bpa is making an incredibly interesting investment opportunity in a market that is set for double digit growth in the coming years in the entire bpa market was valued at $ billion and is expected to reach $ billion by giving it a staggering cagr of in that time frame the business world is getting more competitive across all industries and only those who can create real value for their customers while keeping their costs low are going to succeed business process automation is the magic pill these companies need if they want to not only survive but thrive in the increasingly digital world we live in today company overview at the forefront of the business process automation industry lies exela technologies xela which founded in is ‚Äúleveraging a global footprint and proprietary technology to provide digital transformation solutions enhancing quality productivity and enduser experience‚Äù exela is executing on this mission statement through their turnkey software solution catering to the entire suite of a businesss operations including accounting finance logistics business intelligence human resources customer support and marketing to only name a few combine this with their extensive investments in research and development and exela has developed a strong moat for themselves through numerous patents within robotics and automation exela is also creating value for their customers by offering flexible pricing options through their flagship product ‚Äúdigital now‚Äù which is a single unified cloudbased platform providing multiple solutions to help customers rapidly adopt and deploy their software at an enterprise level with bpa specialists there to help at each step exela makes the transition for companies to implement automated processes incredibly easy and it is showing in their performance an incredible management team delivering on profitability the ceo of exela ron cogburn is bringing over years of leadership experience program management and consulting to the table the rest of the leadership team brings a diverse set of qualifications across multiple industries all using technology to solve realworld problems the company has done an outstanding job of assembling one of the most unrivalled management teams in the field with a combined experience of over years through firsthand experience this leadership team knows just how inefficient and slow some companys operations can be and more importantly how crucial implementing business process automation is if these same companies want to excel within their respective industries in the first quarter of exela saw revenue of $ million an decrease yearoveryear investors shouldnt worry though with the reasoning being the economic repercussions of the coronavirus in and despite this economic slowdown exela was able to improve their margins going from to from last year to now this improvement in margins from is setting exela on a path to profitability sooner than most investors realize and with cash of $ million on the balance sheet exela is emerging from the pandemic primed for growth and stronger than ever before a growth company built to last with the majority of recently ipod companies comes the criticism and concern from analysts that the company has yet to build a strong profile of customers putting them at risk of having a highly concentrated source of their total revenue exela is the exception to this rule with over companies in different countries they have built an incredibly strong customer base to expand on their top customers only make up of their entire customer base and with a large international presence with customers across virtually every industry exela has formed the relationships and revenue sources of a company much older than itself this diverse customer base was no mistake through these relationships exela has created the perfect opportunity to up sell their customers and has no shortage of new products in the pipeline with new modules to be released in the coming year that can be applied across all industries exela is creating an incredibly sticky ecosystem within business process automation as their customers grow and develop new processes so too will their spending with exela as they add more services to help them facilitate growth as efficiently as possible competitor analysis the business process automation market is unquestionably becoming more competitive however a brief comparison of exelas top competitors will show frothy valuations with a clear limited upside in future growth exlservice exls provides operations management and analytics services in select parts of the world with a current market cap of $ billion and an eyepopping trailing months pricetoearnings of this company has years of future success already been baked into their current price eclerx services eclerxns is a competitor coming from india who specializes in data management analytics and offers business process outsourcing with a long history in the industry they were founded in eclerx has achieved a market cap of $ billion and has a current trailing pricetoearnings ratio of this combo of valuation metrics could spell danger for investors who would be paying an excessively high premium for a company that has limited future growth considering their mega cap status companymarket captrailing pe exela$ millionna eclerx$ billion exlservice$ billion ampxb both companies have had their valuation part ways with their fundamentals making it difficult to justify the price investors would pay for shares today exela currently lies in that sweet spot growth investors search so hard to find with a smaller market cap the company has barely grasped of their total addressable market giving them a long runway to grow for many years to come factor this in with the diverse customer base international presence and multiple new products in the pipeline and it becomes clear exela is not only one of the most innovative companies they are also one of the most undervalued at current prices key takeaway the business process automation market is locked in for further growth as new industries and companies realize how they can leverage this technology for their benefit and exela is establishing itself as a major player within the industry at their current valuation the market has not yet priced in exelas future growth prospects and investors today can take advantage of this mistake by buying an incredible growth company at bargain prices,1,2021-07-18 17:08:16

on9wmt,‚ù§Ô∏è carmat alcar ‚ù§Ô∏è aeson artifical hearth dd big news,update since there was a lot of news since i originally published this post im publishing it again with updated informations who is carmat carmat was founded by alain carpentier in he is known to have performed the first artificial heart implant in europe in he is also the father of the mitral valve repair techniques the biggest player behind this company is airbus which cofounded it who is aeson aeson was a king of iolcus in ancient greece but more importantly he reincarnated into the most advanced artificial heart currently on the market ue its currently the only product of carmat who is alcar alcar is the ticker name on euronext for retards who cant buy eu stocks go to chapter can i have more informations on this aeson you need first to understand there is multiple categories for medical cardiac devices lvad left ventricular assist device rvad right ventricular assist device bivad biventricular assist device tah total artificial heart as a retard you would think that tah is amazing and so aeson should be category this not the case aeson is so fucking amazingly advanced that they had to create a new category phrt physiologic heart replacement therapy this is the only device in this category and due to the difficulty of the task there is no other devices which is going to be able to compete with aeson in the near future gt years so why is this aeson so fucking amazingly advanced pulsatility the artificial heart mimics a real heart with pumps ventricles valves autoregulation the embedded sensors and microprocessors allow a live response to changing patient physiological needs it automatically adjusts if the patient walks runs sleeps etc like a real heart hemocompatibility all the surfaces in contact with blood are totally hemocompatible compared to other similar cardiac medical devicesaeson is really safe it is the only one which didnt provoke any stroke gastrointestinal bleeding or infection at the cable site this artificial heart still uses an external battery in any of the study participants so can aeson be used commercially in eu and us right now not so fast not so fast if it was the case the rocket would already have launched a long time ago there is uses category for this device type btr bridge to recovery btt bridge to transplantation btb bridge to bridge dt destination therapy the final target is dt destination therapy which means that the heart is going to be used as a permanent implant in december carmat received ce marking for btt it means that it can be used for now as a temporary solution for patients which can receive real ‚ù§Ô∏è transplantation but are still on the waiting list carmat genius as they are will also use the data from btt patients to push for the dt the first commercial implants are going to be in germany in q as they are ready to reimburse it update first commercial implant was sold and implanted in italy in july in parallel another study eficas is starting in france in q to drive aeson adoption support the value proposition and mainly to get french reimbursement in the us they are starting the efs early feasibility study in q now centers in the us are already trained and ready to implant their first patients update first efs implantation in us done in july ok cool but what is the market size currently the eu market for btt is estimated to be of a minimum size of patients year right now germany is the focus as it represents of the eu market france is following with of the market the competitors did less than interventions in germany and france last year on this type of patient bvad syncardia which is showing that the market is currently without any real competition as the concurrent products arent really as convincing which explains their small volumes the combined euus market for dt is estimated to be around year on these patients around are getting a real heart transplantation each year which is around which gives a market size of the market size is also growing each year for multiple reason ageing of population boomers dying the fatness of fat people is becoming more prevalent not fat shaming intended the number of real ‚ù§Ô∏è transplants could soon slow down as there will be less car accidents with new autopilots system thanks daddy elon an estimated of all organ transplants come from deadly traffic collisions but can carmat produce all these hearts carmat finished building its first factory in france last year it will be soon able to produce ‚ù§Ô∏è year as we see the current eu btt market is large enough for this first factory update currently producing ‚ù§Ô∏èmonth gt ‚ù§Ô∏èmonth as a target for end the timing is really good as they will be able to optimize and streamline the industrialization and production process before the ce destination therapy marking and the bbt dt fda approval with the eu btt market and current production capabilities carmat can partially finance the future studies its development needs and new factories this can prevent too much share dilution it is possible that for future factories in the us carmat could partner up with a big name edwards medtronic abbott johnson amp johnson boston scientifics etc a partnering would give carmat more credibility and a bigger commercial strike force in uncle sam country lets speak $$ revenues valuation quality math economics time sources of revenues the main sources of revenues for carmat are going to be sales of aeson the first aeson was sold in italy this month july for euros or $ aeson maintenance they can be conservatively estimated to be around $year revenues estimates short term revenues estimates i am going to use the future production capabilities of the current factory gt ‚ù§Ô∏è per year i wont be using the maintenance revenues as in the short term only btt category is used medium term revenues estimates im going to use a pessimistic market share long term revenues estimates im going to go with the number of heart which was a minimal target by the prof christian latr√©mouille currently director of surgical affairs at carmat this is still only of market share on a market without real competition it can still be seen as conservative long term revenues estimates im going to go with an arbitrary but realistic market share for mid and long term im going to use a conservative years average survival rate for maintenance revenues it should be a much longer ampxb time referencemathrevenues short term btt only‚ù§Ô∏è x $$m mid term‚ù§Ô∏è $ $$b long term ‚ù§Ô∏è $ $$b long term ‚ù§Ô∏è $ $$b carmat valuation ps ratio advanced analysis we are going to do a quick autistic but realistic valuation of carmat by comparing its revenues to random companies in more or

biotech companies which still need authorizations for their product its true that investing in small biotech companies is not for small balls investors but if you followed carefully which you didnt you would have understood that even in the improbable event that carmat cant have the dt again really improbable more a question of when my model shows that carmat would still be worth more than $ a share solely on taking into account the eu btt market last word it is important to understand that currently only to of the yearly potential patients are surviving more than one year without the aeson it is not a comfort medical device it is a necessity for all these people there is no real competition and there wont be before a long time this product is the result of more than years of research

attention to them as they point to a near market correction including low market breadth and divergence there are fewer stocks rising versus ones declining and a larger number of stocks are hitting the week low than the ones hitting the week high overbought stocks such as aapl amzn msft nvda and arkk all have recently breached the rsi overbought marker and are now dropping fast this ties in well with the poor market breadth as allot of the money existing other stocks as they sell off is just pilling in few top stocks in an unstained way hence the overbought flag reduced volumes signal weakness in the market and provoke profit taking for example the russell average volume has dropped to just under billion per day from a three months average of billion incidentally this index tracks small cap us companies which have been dropping for most of the last weeks for a total decline of thus far major trend line broken for the second time in less than one month the sampp has dipped under its major trend line the first time on may th it reversed and went back up on the back of decent labor and production reports plus earnings expectations now that earnings are underway and most economic indicators are pointing to growth peaking it might not be able to reverse the drop obviously all of the above are technical indicators that try to explain market behavior based on historical metrics but they dont explain the reasons behind such changes we have to look at economic news to identify causes including peaking economic recovery several reports this month point to an economy that has reached peak recovery for example both the services pmi vs vs actual forecast previous and ism vs vs reports for june show a declining rate of expansion also industrial production is showing similar pattern vs vs mixed q banking results also point to the same issue above while the overall figures are up the details point to absence of loan growth and net interest margin weakness declining consumer sentiment while consumer spending came in higher than expected for the month of june consumer sentiment declined from to the main driver behind this is inflation inflation rising the fed has been harping on inflation being transitory because of the ‚Äúbase effect‚Äù and some temporary supply constraints their timeline for all of that to sort out was few months now its more than few months and inflation continues to rage registering the highest figures in over a decade with core cpi the feds favorite metric registering the highest increase since furthermore the ppi producer price index also continues to rise at a rate of in june indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the feds threshold by a wide margin reemergence of a new variant the delta variant is causing allot of lock downs and interruption throughout the world while its effect in the us might be limited a slowing world economy does not bode well for stocks in general hence perhaps the reason why bonds have gone up bond yields going down usually indicates that an economy is slowing and investors are looking for safer assists many have pointed out that bond yields usually peak months in advance of the stock which they did in march since we are in july and bond yield continue to decline many think the bond market is sniffing out something and reacting to it remember the inverse relation between bonds and yields chinas crack on tech has rattled some investors especially that it came at a time when that market was showing sign of bottoming out all of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future most experts expect that sometime after q earnings but it could be starting as we speak especially that corrections dont play out in one straight line they tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out its important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash corrections are a much smaller event ranging around a drop on the low end for the leading sampp index and much more for individual speculative stocks they are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers a crash on the other hand is a much larger event thats usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event crashes usually last much longer than people expect well past the initial large drop there are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repo facility the most prominent of them however is qe tapering quantitative easing and increase in interest rates massive qe and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market they are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the sampp shiller pe ratio is reaching a whopping that is a historic high only second to the dotcom bubble in and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term some argue that the fed will manage to taper qe and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown but given rising inflation beyond expectations the fed might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like equities and bonds expert ray dalio explains this process in his most recent video on youtube,1,2021-07-19

onbfid,bcrx dd potentially the best bioinvestment,the aim of this article is to sum up all the relevant information of the company giving a fair stockprice estimation after discussing the value of each drug in the pipeline we come to the conclusion that bcrx should be valued at $ in case you find the given information helpful i encourage you to support the article in order to reach more people and rise awareness of how undervalued bcrx is the investment thesis with this company remains intact since low s we bcrx longs have been repeating over and over bcrx was a monster in the making we call it the next regeneron a kind of opportunity that just appears once every years probaby the best riskreward ratio in the biosector people did not like bcrx neither they information we gave at $ because the chart looked bad and apparently now that bcrx is up well over all the dd starts to make sense and they are all chasing it bcrxs transformation from a rampd company to a profitable one has just started before starting to read the article my suggestion is to focus more on orladeyo and bcx since both of them are the most valuable assests of the company at the moment if you want to learn more about the company check out ubio uthirdeyeholdings and the community rbcrx some of the informartion related with galidesivir directly come from bios posts once the dd is digested and you understand bcrxs potential if you like money you will realize selling bcrx sub $ is a big mistake you wont want to commit last update ampxb ampxb about biocryst pharmaceuticals inc biocryst pharmaceuticals inc bcrx is a commercialstage drug developer headquartered in durham north carolina that focuses on developing bestinclass oral therapeutics for rare diseases ampxb ampxb unique staff team the company was founded in and is currently led by jon p stonehouse ceo a renowned pharmaceutical executive with over years of thought leadership stonehouse previously served as the senior vice president of corporate development at merck what makes jon stonehouse a unique ceo is the dedication he has towards patients through his commitment to working faster in order to bring lifesaving rare disease therapeutics to patient populations around the world his passion is further substantiated by the note he had pasted on his monitor during the jpm healthcare conference the staff had a predefined plan for orladeyos launch and they perfectly accomplished it with no issues beating analysts estimations by a in the q plus also getting the treatment approved in usaeuropejapanuk in less than months ampxb ampxb institutional ownership apart from having a stellar management team what prospective retail investors should also pay close attention to is biocrysts rockstar institutional investor syndicate which includes both generalist industry stalwarts such as state streetblackrock and sectorspecialist biotech funds like baker brotherssarissa capital the photo shown below mention the institutional entities whose ownership in bcrx is equal or above the mark the numbers given below were posted on march institutional ownership rounds the mark at the moment ampxb pipeline ampxb i orladeyo‚Ñ¢ berotralstat oral pill üíä orladeyo is the first oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema hae disease which is estimated to affect in people orladeyo received usa approval december the rd q orladeyo received japan approval april the th q orladeyo received europe approval april the th q orladeyo received uk approval may the th q orladeyo received israel marketing application june the th q ampxb orladeyo is ranked the most expensive drug in the usa market $ is approximately what patients insurances must monthly pay to access the drug despiste it being an expensive drug its the cheapest and only orally taken option in the hae field ampxb on july th bcrx reported orladeyos apex part data weeks during weeks orladeyo reduced hae attacks from a baseline of attacksmonth to attacksmonth in out of weeks in that weeks period patients had an reduction in their mean attack rate per month during that period ampxb patients medicated with oral orladeyo just have to take one single pill every day instead of orladeyo the other options require the usage of needles meaning patients have to schedule certain days with their doctors to be inyected increasing that feeling of being a sick person orladeyo makes the process easier diminishes that feeling of being a sick person and avoids the needles relatedadverse events potentially reducing patients stress and increasing their quality of life ampxb ceo jon stonehouse confirmed in the last conference call orladeyo will at least be annually generating $mm plus revenue thats the most conservativeconfirmed scenario serge belanger analyst i think in the past youve talked about sales potential for orladeyo of million plus are you still reiterating that target stonehouse ceo yeah make sure you remember the plus ampxb as shown in the january corporate presentation page physicians expect to prescribe orladeyo for over of hae patients ampxb orladeyo value $ sp ampxb ampxb ii pricingsrevenue ampxb usa in the usa there currently are patients diagnosed and treated diagnosed but not treated treated but not diagnosed some of them were not treated because they

conservatively thinking taking patients the diagnosed and treated ones out of the total pool in the usa with over of patients prescription page we would conservatively aim for patients the amount of

sustraction happens as a result of the undergone royalty agreement with torii pharmaceuticals and royalty pharma ampxb ampxb iii q earningsreport beat ampxb on may the th bcrx presented q earnings report data which managed to totally beat analysts estimates basically what matters from this q er is that it was the launch of orladeyo and analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it they were expecting orladeyo sales to top $mm and orladeyo actually generated $mm this is a sales beat the consequence of the er beat was an increase of in the sp ampxb its important to mention that revenues generated this q only came from the usa this q orladeyo has been approved in japaneuropeuk aswell adding new revenue sources orladeyo sales are expected to grow exponentially each quarter as the ceo said next catalysts will be revenues revenues revenues ampxb ampxb iiii orladeyo value ampxb having in mind the discussed numbers before orladeyo alone will be generating $ a year

the current $ million contract to enable completion of a new drug application filing for intravenous iv peramivir ampxb iii peramivir value ampxb with all the explanations given above and having in mind peramivir is a government biodefense drug the value of rapivab can not be less than $ conservatively speaking rapivab value $ ampxb ampxb ampxb iii galidesivir ‚Ñ¢ bcx ampxb galidesivir bcx is a broadspectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security including sarscov the cause of covid ebola marburg yellow fever and zika galidesivir has also demonstrated broadspectrum activity in vitro against more than ribonucleic acid rna viruses in nine different families including coronaviruses filoviruses togaviruses bunyaviruses arenaviruses paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses hepatitis c west nile dengue jap encephalitis yellow fever tbev ohfv and zika orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses galidesivir trials are fully funded by the niaid its a government funded biodefense drug galidesivir was safe and well tolerated in phase clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects ampxb ampxb iiii galidesivir value ampxb we must have in mind that galidesivir is a government funded biodefense drug that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before it has already been stockpilled by the government multiple times and it will in the future given its longterm stability with all the given explanations conservatively talking galidesivir can not be worth less than $mm this is $ ampxb galidesivir value $ ampxb iv bcx ampxb fop is an ultrarare severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton also known as heterotopic ossification ho ho can occur in muscles tendons and soft tissue patients with fop become bound by this irregular ossification over time with restricted movement and fused joints resulting in deformities and premature mortality there are currently no approved treatments for fop there are an estimated to patients worldwide with diagnosed so far market size for this treatment is estimated to reach mm in growing to b in as more patients are diagnosed with a price ranging from $k$myear ‚Äúin ph study bcx demonstrated potency for the target kinase selectivity safety and strong suppression of ho in animal models safe and well tolerated‚Äù ampxb ampxb ivi bcx value ampxb considering that drugs that are in phase studies are said to have a chance of making it to the market and the tam it aims for is $mm bcx as of now shuld be valued at $ $ bcx value $ ampxb ampxb v oral factor d inhibitor bcx üíä ampxb bcx is a novel oral potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of factor d which recently completed phase clinical development for the treatment of complementmediated diseases treatment that is able to control both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis fda granted fast track orphan drug designation for bcxs pnh study bcx is an oral inhibitor of the factor d enzyme that activates factor b to form the c alternative pathway developing this kind of inhibitors aint easy at all most of this inhibitors in the development process fail or obtain poor results at the moment bcx is the bestinclass inhibitor in the game reasons will be explained below ampxb ampxb ampxb vi staff excitement ampxb staff team from biocryst pharmaceuticals obviously are very excited and positive about bcx upcoming future such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the ceo jon pstonehouse or the vice president william psheridan would say the following words ampxb ‚Äúit truly is an embarrassment of riches‚Äù ‚Äúwe agree with alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral factor d inhibitor bcx is a great challenge and we are happy we have one‚Äù ‚Äúmy only concern is i have no concerns‚Äù ‚Äúpipeline in a molecule‚Äù ‚Äúmy aim is to make c inhibitors obsolete‚Äù ‚Äúthis is big‚Äù bcx is a really terrifically exciting project ampxb ampxb vii phase i study ampxb on march bcrx announced that bcx will be advancing from ph to pivotal ph trials in pnh following the successful proof of concept trial totally skipping the ph pivotal ph trials for pnh and proof of concept trials in renal complementmediated diseases are expected to begin in h straight jumping from a ph to a pivotal ph trial is something thats not common in the bio world it accelerates the process of the drug develoment giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time the quicker the drug is in the market the better and the more value it brings for investors ampxb on march the company unveiled bcx ph data of treatmentna√Øve patients and of c inhibitor inadequate response patients were transfusionfree prior to the trial of treatmentna√Øve patients and of c inadequate responders were transfusionfree hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of gdl in treatmentna√Øve patients and gdl in c inhibitor inadequate response patients at last visit mean hemoglobin levels were gdl and gdl respectively ampxb ampxb viii data comparison with the competition ampxb to understand properly how good bcx data was in the pic below barclays plc gathered the data from the main studies in this kind of inhibitors in the q er conferencecall apart from reporting excellent orladeyo revenues the company announced it came to an agreement with the fda basically they changed the primary and secondary endpoints of bcxs study from now on the change of hgb levels from baseline and the tranfusion free reduction will be the main endpoints of the study so pay close attention in the chart given below to the underlined numbers in red those are the hgb level change from baseline and the transfusion free units reduction numbers bcx by far has achieved the best results making it the bestinclass treatment ampxb the main competition in the field of this kind of inhibitors is conformed by the treatments mentioned below ampxb alexion solirisüíâc hgb approved ultomorisüíâc hgbapproved danicopanachüíä factor d hgbph apellis pegcetacoplanüíâfactor d hgbnda novartis iptacopanlnpüíä factor b hgbph biocryst bcxüíä factor d hgbph ampxb kols key opinion leaders praised bcx ph data regarding the transfusion rate reduction noting it couldnt have achieved better results it cant do any better transfusion reduction basically bcx posted such good data that fda wants the treatment in the market the quicker the possible thats why they skipped the ph jumping from ph to pivotal phs and also changed the primarysecondary endpoints of the study to ease the approval path ampxb ampxb viv alternative pathway ampxb what makes bcx a game changer is it being an oral inhibitor of the factor d enzyme that controls both extravascular and intravascular haemolysis advantage that widens the spectrum of alternative pathway dysregulation disease it can treat other inhibitors like alexions soliris c can just treat up to diseases ahuspnh while ours bcx aims for diseases page as of now thats why insiders call it ‚Äúpipeline in a molecule‚Äù those diseases are shown in the pic below ampxb ampxb vv potential market size by ampxb assuming bcx will be approved by and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned diseases we reach to the following conclusion the potential market size bcx will be aiming for by scores up to $b $b year this numbers are explained below ampxb due to covid the market for pnh and ahus was anticipated to grow from us$ million in to us$ million by it is expected to grow at a cagr of during ‚Äì ‚Äú anca vasculitis prevalence in the usa rounds per million patients using soliris which costs $year we would aim for b b market size as of now expected to grow by ‚Äú the global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach usd billion by according to a new report by grand view research inc ‚Äúigan the gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone prevalence rounds million meaning patients or a potential b market size using soliriss yearly price cg prevalence in the usa round per m people patients if those patients were to be treated with soliris which costs $ year the potential market size we aim for rounds b b pmn prevalence is similar to the one of igan so we would potentially aim for a similar market size meaning b ampxb ampxb vvi alexion buy out on december the th alexion announced that astrazeneca was going to buy them out for b more than of their revenue come from their c inhibitor being that the main reason why astrazeneca wanted that buy out to happen you might think why does this matter well remember we have thebest in class factor d which has shown to be more effective than alexions and is able to treat x times more diseases than they do aswell this buy out reflects how undervalued bcx is apart from the buy out i think its essential to mention that alexion bought achillions factor d when it was in ph for $mm in alexions soliris¬Æ eculizumab ultomoris¬Æ ravulizumab net product sales were $b treatments that are currently approved to treat pnh and ahus as a quick example using the average biotech midcap x revenue multiplier and the revenue soliris managed to generate in b b it would mean a sp value of $ for bcrx i want to make clear again that bcx is said to be best inclass treatment and its able to treat x times more diseases therefore aims for a bigger tam ampxb ampxb vvii solirisultomoris patients survey ampxb bcrx recently did a survey with pnh patients of them using ultomiris and the other soliris the survey showed that of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below ampxb ampxb some of the patients treated with bcx were asked some questions among them the th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with bcx twice a day oral pill as we have seen it before with orladeyo patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oralpill form treatments ampxb ampxb ampxb vviii bcx valuation ampxb having in mind bcx is a the bestinclass treatment that alexion got bought out for b mainly for their c inhibitor and the yearly market size bcx aims for in rounds the $b mark bcx valuation can not be less than a of alexions buy out price this is b meaning $ same thing as with orladeyo happens here bcx is an orally taken treatment the other approved treatments out there requiere usage of needles so we shoud expect bcx to follow orladeyos steps or perhaps perform even better now that the company has gained valuable experince with the launch of orladeyo ampxb bcx value $ ampxb ampxb ampxb strong bo buy out candidate as we have explained in the institutional section before all good biotech investors do know who alexander jdenner founder of sarissa capital is after recently increasing his stake in bcrx along with blackrock he now owns a of biocryst pharmaceuticals inc denner has increased his position in bcrx by an stunning in the last quarters showing strong conviction in the company since denner opened his position in alexion it took him months to close the buy out deal as shown in the picture below ampxb after this exhaustive analysis of the company we can easily acknowledge that bcrx is more than a strong bo candidate a buy out coming from biogen biib company where denner forms part of the bod board of directors would make total sense in the following years once bcx factor d phase iii data is unveiled biibs financial position in the last year has notoriously worsened the profitability has gone down a in the last year they need new revenue sources and bcrxs excellent pipeline could change so takeda tak could be another excellent suitor for the bo considering how orladeyo is stealing its hae patients market share ampxb it also is important to mention that bank of america added bcrx to the list of top mampa candidates mergers and acquisitions as of october th stating how they believe bcrx will have a strong revenue growth in the upcoming years ampxb ampxb alexions performance with soliris ampxb alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we should expect from biocryst in the upcoming years from to alexions sp grew a being valued at $ in and $ in revenue generated by alexion gradually grew up as their c inhibitor was approved to treat additional diseases firstly pnh then ahus as the market size it captured became wider and the amount of patients it treated slowly scored up biocryst pharmaceuticals sp managing to do the sp move alexions stock did is more than doable considering the unique pipeline it possess having in mind alexion made mm revenue the first year while bcrx expects to generate mm plus with orladeyo apart from it additional revenues generated by rapivabgalidesivir stockpillings may come ampxb ampxb derisked company last december the th bcrx announced they made a royalty agreement with royalty pharma and athyrium capital management with this agreement bcrx was funded with $ in order to support orladeyo launch jon stonehouse ceo confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore its important to restate that as part of the royalty agreement royalty pharma will receive a on global net sales of bcx if approved ampxb ampxb forward looking statements ampxb from now on earningreports should be catalysts and extremely positive for the company orladeyo european launch the company will have to provide some colour on the bcx pnh pivotal ph trial how it will be planned etc etc aswell as the proof of conecept trials in complementmediated diseases bcx next steps should soon be shared by the company bcx galidesivir next steps it recently completed a ph additional information about the study may be given its important to mention that this study was fully funded by the niaid galidesivirrapivab stockpilling ampxb ceo said the main catalysts will be revenues revenues revenues ampxb ampxb conclusion after this exhaustive analysis we come to the conclusion that bcrx is severely undervalued and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline it should be valued around $ pt will keep growing as we get new data updates from the ongoing studies and orladeyo revenues keep growing potentially making it have the best riskreward ratio in the biosector i naturally do have a position in this company my average entry price being around the

on loan i did some calculations to come up with the realistic amc sp when all the legal shares are returned my calculations for the legal shares on loan when returned first here it goes amc share price jumped from $ to $ with m legal shares returned on june nd if m legal shares on loan are returned amc sp should be about $ if m legal shares on loan are returned amc sp should be about $ if all m legal shares on loan are returned amc sp should be about $ i estimated there are about b synthetic shares my estimate is low wes christian thinks b to b synthetic shares there may be more i will provide my calculations for amc sp based on my b synthetic shares created b and b synthetic shares if b synthetic shares are returned buy backcovered amc sp should be about $ if b synthetic shares are covered amc sp should be about $ if b synthetic shares are covered amc sp should be about $ we will find out the numbers of synthetic shares when chad amp wes count them i believe there will be fomo when amc sp starts to run from $ there are probably many paper hands that will jump in once we short squeeze starts the high of amc sp might be higher than $ due to other variables fomo gamma squeeze more than b synthetic shares etc the moass will happen short hfsmms can only delayed the inevitable it will come sooner or later i am hodling amp buying until these greedcorrupted short hfs cover these are only my research and opinions do your own research before investing and some additional research by ee amc will likely surpass volkswagen sp when it has its short squeeze why a m apes strong the numbers continue to grow each trading day b apes own amc legal shares by institution c i believe there are about b b synthetic shares d there are more shorted amc shares legal amp illegal than any other stocks when all the synthetic shares are officially counted e apes own about of all legal amp illegal shares f short hfsmms have been heavily shorting amc for the past months at about $ avg short position short hfsmms used at least different shorting tactics a they short in the lit nyse market b they massively bought in the dark pool amp sold those shares in the lit market to manipulate sp to strike stop losses amp get rid of paper hands c they short via the etf any and all etf with amc stock d they short using options e they short via converting convertible notesbondsdeath spiral debt into shares amp short those shares aa decided to withdraw $m convertible bond to not give them any ammo f they short by fake selling among their many accounts to drive sp lower to strike stop losses g even with ssr they have the ability to mark short shares as short exempt most if not all short hfsmms are under water since the avg short position was $ about months ago they are massive in over their heads they will have to cover their short position eventually its a delay tactic to get as many paper hands out as possible before they cover but they have not covered it instead they continue doubletriplequadruple down with their short positions check the short interest it keeps going up they own more than of the media be careful what you read the more under water these short hfsmms are the more desperate they are amp the more fud fud fud fud fud we seehear they pump other stocks to get some paper hands to leave the amc position to chase then dump those stocks the only stocks with majority of apes holding are amc amp gme amc continues to have more buying orders than selling orders even when its on low volume day amp sp down remember the shorting tactics mentioned on item i believe the market will likely crash due to amc stock the banks know this some are shutting down all existing personal lines of credit in coming weeks amc anticipates that this weekend black widow will beat f last weeks opening the poirier vs the mcgregor fight will be shown at amc theaters this weekend the cdc amp fda think the current vaccination will likely be safe for the delta variance they do not think the booster shots are needed for the delta variance at this point this is great news for amc short hfsmms will likely go bankrupt if they continue to double down their short positions the options t threshold security listing for calendar days plus t which mean next week last week of july middle of august early september etc start with june th count calendar days from june then add t trading day we might be in this position until the end of or better half of due to all the call options and if amc continues to be on the threshold securities list in the weeks and months ahead i believe short hfsmms will likely stop shorting at some point all the sec amp finra rules have been put in place to stop this corrupted system for a more transparency amp level playing field for retail apes the short hfsmms often choose to pay the fines rather than stop shorting the best case scenario i see is for them to short get in more deep water and start to go long or play some call options to recoup their losses it costs them about $ billion a day with the ctb fees it costs apes nothing to hodl they have not been covered yet i am hodling for as long as it takes until i see these short hfsmms cover the gamma squeeze will eventually happen with all the call option contracts the mother of all squeezes is inevitable and will likely trigger once gamma squeeze strikes $ when the moass strikes we will likely see the most violent sp jumpscall options t amp ftd of calendar day plus t will likely play out for weeks amp months this is the social amp culture movement play to bankrupt these short hfsmms anyone talking about the fundamentals or tell you about other shorted stocks is fud to get you out of your game these are only my research and opinions do your own research

greenidges mining is already up running and supportcom will continue its work postmerger kinda like bonus money plus as said before they can provide power to customers additional revenue energy markets capacity markets and waste heat will all provide additional income for greenidge üì∑ management knows what theyre doing i mean they legit cucked the ny state congress convincing pretty liberal senators to change a law and allow a natural gas power plant near a lake its clean energy and safe but still they lobby better than nancy pelosi knows how to trade yolo options and thats saying something üì∑ caption pelosi be ‚Äúimsogold‚Äù or peepow the dd for the company can get quite long and you can easily search around and find a more comprehensive valuation basis but the company isnt garbage im not here to talk too much about fundamentals though they are strong im here to add to the existing knowledge with lizard brain technical setup theory part lizard üì∑ float the float actually available to the public is important yahoo uses m shares as float but it differs depending on the website turns out this m number is an overcount the actual float is just below m ill show my numbers and math below but lowkey its pretty boring so feel free to jump over it all begin math as a baseline i assumed the high estimate of m shares outstanding though finviz says shares outstanding is m from there i took a dive into some sec f filings and merger filings funnnnnn btw f filings are released quarterly for fund managers with gtm in assets and show their individual holdings ampxb greenidge generation surprise surprise the company that support is merging with owns a large stake but how large is large for this bad boi well look at the ‚Äã‚Äãsa nd page before table of contents as part of the merger agreement lets note that capital llc has already acquired shares of support additionally according to the s greenidge holds of shares outstanding quick math is but if bezos is going to the moon its sorry got distracted but quick math shows that of shares outstanding accounted for radoff bradley louis aka chad according to the da that radoff bradley my wifes boyfriend filed he owns shares of support about quick math of shares accounted for insiders though i prefer to look at filings to verify the accuracy of numbers especially with respect to float its tiring af reading through this obscure verbiage so lets just rely on the insider ownership reported here if we sum the columns we get to of support held by insiders with of this number being nonqualified stock options im not sure if this is the total number of options or the total number of shares that these options represent so lets ignore them leaving us with common restricted shares held by support insiders or of the company quick math of shares accounted for kershner trading americas in their last ga filing they had shares of support down from the shares they had in april but shares are shares so thats of support quick math of shares accounted for renaissance technologies oh this name sticks out their last filing was the q f on if you download the xml put it into your fave text editor arhmm sublimetext and search for supports cusip number w youll see our baby lil gem shining like a star so renaissance owns shares of support or around quick math of shares accounted for blackrock ok ok big dick willy blackrock is in the house same thing as renaissance q f on download the xml search for supports cusip number w youll see lil babes blackrock owns shares or around quick math of shares accounted for vanguard ah the people who came up with the concept of an etf nice safe and friendly yoy returns etfs those things aka not support üöÄ üåö check the q f and see babes vanguard owns shares of support quick math of shares accounted for geode capital management see q f see babes geode own good numer math add bridgeway capital bridgeway capital q f own k number good me like total fuck i cant continue looking at these fucking filings vyvanse is starting to wear off and im starting to talk like an ape lets wrap it up of shares are held by institutional investors or employees so were at a m float since were trying to be precise when the filing says ‚Äúgreenidge approximately owns of support‚Äù they actually mean so its actually which makes the float closer to m but it turns out institutions own a bit more through mutual funds fuck it lets do more mindnumbing calculations for mutual funds if you calculate all the ones listed that are not vanguard and bridgeway thats approx k shares of support owned or of shares outstanding which brings us to a m float its annoying af but you have to calculate this shit by hand since the data online is sometimes off trust but verify end math tldr the float is just under m due to institutions merger deals and mutual funds variables impacting a squeeze include limited float tightening short constraints price instability and major positive catalysts clearly number has been addressed moving on to number tightening short constraints support just made the sho threshold security list last week july a situation that experts this paper pg label as gtan exogenous shock that tightens the short sale constraint this coincides with a major t closeout period from a massive spike in failuretodelivers coming due next week more later historic volatility has been increasing and it has been getting more intense the past trading days bullish flow is repeatedly met by short sellers ortex daily data shows increases to keep the stock falling short sellers are aggressive leaving support on the sho threshold security list for the last two days in their attempts so some short sellers isare pretty underwater and cant afford the price to rise even short interest mil shorts on loan of a mil float utilization rate no shares to borrow soaring cost to borrow short demand is high supply is low bullish consolidation up why is it so hard to borrow even if the mil on loan ortex estimate is off exchange reported si is mil of a mil float shorts are completely maxed out unless they start working over float short interest which didnt end so well for them last time see gme üì∑ all metrics that ortex provides are soaring shares on loan utilization cost to borrow even days to cover are peaking indicating that shorting constraints are getting in a critical area after the deep dive on filings its clear that mil mil shares aka of the float are sold short and shorts have taken a huge position note that m si is the number reported by exchanges as of june th in the negg dd i made a case that ftd spikes correspond with shorts opening large positions support has had ftd spikes from june th to june th and it has been on the sho threshold security list since last thursday so we can infer that there are ftd spikes happening right now so considering the ortex metrics are spiking and ftds are off the charts to the point that support has been on the sho threshold security list for multiple weeks in june and is on it right now the m si number reported by exchanges as of june is pretty conservative imo ftd squeeze but wait theres more in my previous negg dd i made a case that ftds can be used as an approximation for the point when shorts are the most vulnerable how do ftds translate to upward potential the sec and sho regulations state that shorts must close out within days t from hitting a failtodeliver excerpt from section iv below gtrule provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver specifically if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed the firm has up to calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity üì∑ guess when t is from the gigantic spike in june thats right june th days july this coming tuesday tuesday and the next two weeks should see solid volatility and volatility is profitable lets zoom in on this ftd activity we see aggressive opening of short positions with a negligible effect on the price shorts are deep which makes sense for the repeated attempt at forcing down any increase in price protecting a fragile underwater position üì∑ usually as you can see in the graph below for my other babes pubm large ftd spikes are usually associated with rather deep depressions in price usually around local or global minimums this is not happening with support so shorts are exhausting a lot of capital with marginal effects on the price this is good üì∑ cost to borrow amp short availability the borrow rate below concurs that shorts are becoming tight and locating shares to borrow is becoming harder and harder shorts are going underwater and this coincides with the major activity recently they are spiking up the cost to borrow and depleting the number of shares available to borrow while the price bleeds up üì∑ caption red is cost to borrow and blue is number of shares available to borrow no shares left to borrow after the shorts shorted down the k in call options when the market opened friday last week support had run out of shares to borrow multiple times and this can explain the sho threshold security list inclusion on thursday friday since if they could short by regular means then support would not be on the list üì∑ price instability price is becoming increasingly more unstable aka liquidity is drying up which makes sense since so much of the float is locked up why is this important btw well quickly before amc popped $ there was extreme afterhours volume in which tick data displayed one of the telltale signs of extremely poor liquidity amp price instability barcoding üì∑ there are some good approximations for price instability intraday there support is showing widening bid ask spreads and a limited orderbook historic volatility is also increasing üì∑ ive also noticed that over the past trading days the price has become even more volatile last thursday and friday you can look at the tape and see that the bullish flow of price peaks of is met by immediate shorting normal players dont get excited by a intraday price move thats not an investor and retail in this situation would be encouraged to fomo and buy more thats a short seller protecting a price point in an increasingly unstable environment shit indicators are even picking this up as well see below üì∑ positive catalyst why are these shorts so deep seems like they were hoping the merger would fall through before they needed to cover after trying to short supportcom into oblivion pre merger news in march now they need to cover their shorts before the merger happens or theyre fucked unfortunately for them all is good on the gree front greenridge updated their share registration with supportcom on friday people have also noticed that there is now a scheduled meeting on monday at am the entire supportcom team sent a message back in the winter to their team holders and investors basically drooling over this passing and we have confirmation its working its way forward also greenridge and their investors already own of support see the float section the bear case seems to be on unstable grounds part technical setup we touched briefly on the technical setup earlier support is solid bottom of trendline in a standard deviation channel and rsi is coiling on the hr ftd positive impact to be seen in following weeks upper resistance is easily broken with a move up from shorts closing confirmed by recent calls for c cup and handle üì∑ in addition to current short set up si is at an all time high mil short of an estimated milmil float utilization is no more ammo for shorts x daily volume needed for shorts to close üì∑ part tldr positions who knows what happens with price volatility but the margin of safety is getting larger and larger at least for me riskreward ratio is good for me and the probability of bullish action post merger for me seems pretty high hence im betting on gree position is crazy right now ill update with further holdings on monday ampxb,1,2021-07-19 07:53:04

with owns a large stake but how large is large for this bad boi well look at the ‚Äã‚Äãsa nd page before table of contents as part of the merger agreement lets note that capital llc has already acquired shares of support additionally according to the s greenidge holds of shares outstanding quick math is but if bezos is going to the moon its sorry got distracted but quick math shows that of shares outstanding accounted for radoff bradley louis aka chad according to the da that radoff bradley my wifes boyfriend filed he owns shares of support about quick math of shares accounted for insiders though i prefer to look at filings to verify the accuracy of numbers especially with respect to float its tiring af reading through this obscure verbiage so lets just rely on the insider ownership reported here if we sum the columns we get to of support held by insiders with of this number being nonqualified stock options im not sure if this is the total number of options or the total number of shares that these options represent so lets ignore them leaving us with common restricted shares held by support insiders or of the company quick math of shares accounted for kershner trading americas in their last ga filing they had shares of support down from the shares they had in april but shares are shares so thats of support quick math of shares accounted for renaissance technologies oh this name sticks out their last filing was the q f on if you download the xml put it into your fave text editor arhmm sublimetext and search for supports cusip number w youll see our baby lil gem shining like a star so renaissance owns shares of support or around quick math of shares accounted for blackrock ok ok big dick willy blackrock is in the house same thing as renaissance q f on download the xml search for supports cusip number w youll see lil babes blackrock owns shares or around quick math of shares accounted for vanguard ah the people who came up with the concept of an etf nice safe and friendly yoy returns etfs those things aka not support üöÄ üåö check the q f and see babes vanguard owns shares of support quick math of shares accounted for geode capital management see q f see babes geode own good numer math add bridgeway capital bridgeway capital q f own k number good me like total fuck i cant continue looking at these fucking filings vyvanse is starting to wear off and im starting to talk like an ape lets wrap it up of shares are held by institutional investors or employees so were at a m float since were trying to be precise when the filing says ‚Äúgreenidge approximately owns of support‚Äù they actually mean so its actually which makes the float closer to m but it turns out institutions own a bit more through mutual funds fuck it lets do more mindnumbing calculations for mutual funds if you calculate all the ones listed that are not vanguard and bridgeway thats approx k shares of support owned or of shares outstanding which brings us to a m float its annoying af but you have to calculate this shit by hand since the data online is sometimes off trust but verify end math tldr the float is just under m due to institutions merger deals and mutual funds variables impacting a squeeze include limited float tightening short constraints price instability and major positive catalysts clearly number has been addressed moving on to number tightening short constraints support just made the sho threshold security list last week july a situation that experts this paper pg label as gtan exogenous shock that tightens the short sale constraint this coincides with a major t closeout period from a massive spike in failuretodelivers coming due next week more later historic volatility has been increasing and it has been getting more intense the past trading days bullish flow is repeatedly met by short sellers ortex daily data shows increases to keep the stock falling short sellers are aggressive leaving support on the sho threshold security list for the last two days in their attempts so some short sellers isare pretty underwater and cant afford the price to rise even short interest mil shorts on loan of a mil float utilization rate no shares to borrow soaring cost to borrow short demand is high supply is low bullish consolidation up why is it so hard to borrow even if the mil on loan ortex estimate is off exchange reported si is mil of a mil float shorts are completely maxed out unless they start working over float short interest which didnt end so well for them last time see gme üì∑ all metrics that ortex provides are soaring shares on loan utilization cost to borrow even days to cover are peaking indicating that shorting constraints are getting in a critical area after the deep dive on filings its clear that mil mil shares aka of the float are sold short and shorts have taken a huge position note that m si is the number reported by exchanges as of june th in the negg dd i made a case that ftd spikes correspond with shorts opening large positions support has had ftd spikes from june th to june th and it has been on the sho threshold security list since last thursday so we can infer that there are ftd spikes happening right now so considering the ortex metrics are spiking and ftds are off the charts to the point that support has been on the sho threshold security list for multiple weeks in june and is on it right now the m si number reported by exchanges as of june is pretty conservative imo ftd squeeze but wait theres more in my previous negg dd i made a case that ftds can be used as an approximation for the point when shorts are the most vulnerable how do ftds translate to upward potential the sec and sho regulations state that shorts must close out within days t from hitting a failtodeliver excerpt from section iv below gtrule provides an extended period of time to close out certain failures to deliver specifically if a failure to deliver position results from the sale of a security that a person is deemed to own and that such person intends to deliver as soon as all restrictions on delivery have been removed the firm has up to calendar days following the trade date to close out the failure to deliver position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity üì∑ guess when t is from the gigantic spike in june thats right june th days july this coming tuesday tuesday and the next two weeks should see solid volatility and volatility is profitable lets zoom in on this ftd activity we see aggressive opening of short positions with a negligible effect on the price shorts are deep which makes sense for the repeated attempt at forcing down any increase in price protecting a fragile underwater position üì∑ usually as you can see in the graph below for my other babes pubm large ftd spikes are usually associated with rather deep depressions in price usually around local or global minimums this is not happening with support so shorts are exhausting a lot of capital with marginal effects on the price this is good üì∑ cost to borrow amp short availability the borrow rate below concurs that shorts are becoming tight and locating shares to borrow is becoming harder and harder shorts are going underwater and this coincides with the major activity recently they are spiking up the cost to borrow and depleting the number of shares available to borrow while the price bleeds up üì∑ caption red is cost to borrow and blue is number of shares available to borrow no shares left to borrow after the shorts shorted down the k in call options when the market opened friday last week support had run out of shares to borrow multiple times and this can explain the sho threshold security list inclusion on thursday friday since if they could short by regular means then support would not be on the list üì∑ price instability price is becoming increasingly more unstable aka liquidity is drying up which makes sense since so much of the float is locked up why is this important btw well quickly before amc popped $ there was extreme afterhours volume in which tick data displayed one of the telltale signs of extremely poor liquidity amp price instability barcoding üì∑ there are some good approximations for price instability intraday there support is showing widening bid ask spreads and a limited orderbook historic volatility is also increasing üì∑ ive also noticed that over the past trading days the price has become even more volatile last thursday and friday you can look at the tape and see that the bullish flow of price peaks of is met by immediate shorting normal players dont get excited by a intraday price move thats not an investor and retail in this situation would be encouraged to fomo and buy more thats a short seller protecting a price point in an increasingly unstable environment shit indicators are even picking this up as well see below üì∑ positive catalyst why are these shorts so deep seems like they were hoping the merger would fall through before they needed to cover after trying to short supportcom into oblivion pre merger news in march now they need to cover their shorts before the merger happens or theyre fucked unfortunately for them all is good on the gree front greenridge updated their share registration with supportcom on friday people have also noticed that there is now a scheduled meeting on monday at am the entire supportcom team sent a message back in the winter to their team holders and investors basically drooling over this passing and we have confirmation its working its way forward also greenridge and their investors already own of support see the float section the bear case seems to be on unstable grounds part technical setup we touched briefly on the technical setup earlier support is solid bottom of trendline in a standard deviation channel and rsi is coiling on the hr ftd positive impact to be seen in following weeks upper resistance is easily broken with a move up from shorts closing confirmed by recent calls for c cup and handle üì∑ in addition to current short set up si is at an all time high mil short of an estimated milmil float utilization is no more ammo for shorts x daily volume needed for shorts to close üì∑ part tldr positions who knows what happens with price volatility but the margin of safety is getting larger and larger at least for me riskreward ratio is good for me and the probability of bullish action post merger for me seems pretty high hence im betting on gree position is crazy right now ill update with further holdings on monday ampxb ampxb,1,2021-07-19 08:04:07

onhxhj,us oil amp gas stonks big bull market a cummin,unless youve been sleeping behind the wendys dumpster youve heard the news oil stonks just got double bukkakid and dumped in the river like a hooker who got in the psychos white van straight up ima one of them retards who btfd a bit too early accounts down on this horrorshow so far thank the gods i didnt jump into next weeks fd calls with everything like my ape brain was screaming to do on friday that said ima baghodlin big pos in gush the x bull oil eampp sector etf that x ticker xop and xle sampp energy sector etf i think the sell off is a bear trap this stocks will be ripping into years end and probably here is my expert dd forget covid deltsmelta whatever most oil is used in chemical and industrial machines and personal driving i callin bull on a widespread lockdown aint the west vaxxd things that might be shutdown like airlines and crusie ship never really restarted much and demand wise are just a fart in the wind anyway the thesis is monkey nuts simple we are crazy oil addicts and our supply is about to slow down in the next year the suitsare lying they dont want us to know its comming so they can buy or oil stonks and make the big $$ why oil shortage coming a new oil wells flow gushes then quickly declines till they have to constantly be drilling new ones for the world to keep the oil withdrawal money off out backs even a little dip below our taste for the black horse piss and prices spike and people start polishing their ars getting ready for mad max nobody is drilling so its only a matter of time wen lambo within the next year why no drilling covid lockdowns created a glut they cut production hard now the are brining it back online but inventories of oil globally are still crashing hard oh but you say we not an pre covid production yet yeah pre covid production of oil is not impossible and the suits know it oil is going to moon once they buy all the oil stonks and drop the news but how does this dumb ape know here ampxb us oil rigs and production last years production dropped suddenly during covid but i wasnt because rigs stopped drill the did stop drilling but production dropped under government orders to prevent out pipeline system from literally overflow and cause huge damage the slight uptict of productions is the last curtailment orders being lifted in otherwords about mil barrels of oil capacity is all we in the states got folks weve had mill barrels a day depletion in the last months or so since covid what about muh opec im not going in to tire you all but all those state run foreign oil companies raided the drilling budgets to keep they countries from faling over the biggest oil producer saudi arabia was already underinvesting in drilling going into covid because they had more capacity that their opec quota allowed them to sell the state oil company aramco way ipod so the king could load it with debt without anyone thinking his country was going into a hole their drilling budget was $ bil already light by all measures considering they do of world oil production the cut that in half for and saudi arabia is the richest of the opec countries if the are burning the furniture to preserve cash you can be all the other me countries havent drilled hardly a well the last months either then there is mexico they produce like of the worlds oil have you read that the friggin cartels are takening over and stealing the oil yeah criminals are not the best investment managers they like to take and run not reinvest cashflow into the future of infrastructure they are not legally allow to take from in the first place the impact of this doesnt even require oil demand to keep rebounding it probably will but even if it mutters along a some slightly lower level because of muh zoom workin from home bs depletion will still hit the supply side hard in the next year its the perfect storm really keep in mind the world missed out on a year and half of proper dilling and maintenance thats not going to be fixed overnight oh yea and last the fed is printing money you certainly have to have noticed the all fresh crisp $s youve been picking freelancing behind the wendys right thats always good for oil ampxb so whats the trade i just buy the xop adn xle xle has some less oil price dependent stuff like pipelines refinery companies and oil field service folks xle is the longer term more stable play to the bull market which i say will last years minimum xop is the fast money piece it pops first and i smell the tendies on this in the next year if you go all degen gamble on it leap otm calls but then you a gansta im too much of paper handed bitch and would sell too early cuz im terified of the theta gang stonk i can hdol more easily ampxb tldr cramer has been all over cnbc claiming oil is top because the us shale producers are bringing piles of wells online and the us market cant handle the oil that should be all you need to know the suits are running a play to dump oil stonks to them so they can load the boat oil bull market next years,1,2021-07-19 09:46:56

onigc3,picking options for risky earnings plays,hi everyone i wanted to share with you my process of choosing which options to trade around earnings i am mainly on the buy side here so very risky with time decay and iv playing against you but the hope is to catch tail events that are outside the market expectation already priced in i pick the stocks from the recommendations of my ml model this post this used to be a model trying to predict high movement more than and i refined it to actually predict when the movement is more than what the market expects this is usually derived from the break even of the options prices and that i approximate to be the average of the movements around the last five releases plus times std basically miming a gaussian if youre familiar with that the model outputs a list of stocks that should outperform this value and so beat the market update coming soon on this btw for this week we have $aal $hon and $nee lets continue with aal then i use earningswatchertech hosted version of my model to make some projections the average historic movement is with a distribution of movements absolute value that looks like this we actually like this type of histogram because of the fat tail we see on the right and thats what we will be betting on lets make some projections about the expected movement based on this conservative ideal wow range $ $range $ $range $ $ now lets look at different options combinations we are mostly interested in the movement of the stock with no preference for direction so we will be choosing strangles i automated scrapping options prices to get this summary we see that the price per contract decreases a lot as we go further in the money but so does the break even using optionstratcom we can estimate gains and losses from these plays we have to account for the severe iv crush that happens after the release and that will make our options loose most of their value if theyre not in the money the closer to the money the strangle is the higher your chances of recouping some of what you payed for but then your gains are also lower in case of a tail event same for further expirations we can see this in the next graph based on this i made this recap of gainsloss estimates strangleprice contractbreak evengains at move p c$ p c$ my strategy here is to pick the riskiest play for each of the recommended stocks and usually one tail event makes enough profits to compensate for the other losses so i picked the pc and fingers crossed for at least a move basically if no tail i lose small if tail i win big sort of like a vc investing in start ups hope this helps and happy to discuss more,1,2021-07-19 10:11:21

onvd7b,tiger brokers tigrs forecasted profit,looking at tiger brokers tigrs q results i tweak certain assumptions in my previous forecast which allows me to reach a profit forecast of at least million usd of profit this is good in a way that my forecast was reasonably reliable except that certain assumptions like funded accounts and average deposits per funded accounts were slightly off nevertheless the positive implications brought along by higher user account and higher trading activity did compensate for some small misses my original assumptions for number of funded accounts were and customer deposits to reach billion usd in q i have to admit that i was assuming that management was pushing for funded accounts growth rate per quarter to remain at around whereas the latest figures to reach the funded accounts target for the management is around accounts looking at q i do not think q would be an issue to meet such growth assumptions and considering my market view that nasdaq will reach further higher point to around there are reasons to believe that the accounts can be met i recently chatted with a singaporean friend who funded a tiger brokers account pursuant to a marketing campaign by tiger brokers he explained that the recent experience gives him confidence to use tiger application to trade and invest shares considering that he is a highly conservative individual i has reasons to believe that more people will adopt tiger brokers application nevertheless i certainly hope tiger brokers management can deliver even better results in terms of acquiring funded accounts launching new products enhancing user experience etc one low hanging fruit to enhance the companys profit i believe could be reducing the corporate tax paid by tiger broker i had a quick look at one of its competitors and notice that the implied tax rate paid by tiger brokers is around if this can be reduced significantly even by Ôºåtiger brokers could easily pick up at least million usd per quarter assuming the profit remains constant naturally we know this is not possible considering that settlement rate of us shares is only now there is a significant room to lift up the profits of tiger brokers furthermore with more customer deposits there would be avenues to capitalise on higher interest income below is a breakdown of the key items of tiger brokers revenue stream commissions financing services fee interest income settlement and clearing fees ¬†other revenues with higher funded accounts plus customer deposits and trading activity it is only natural for the first items to go up with the percentage of self clearing of us trades tiger brokers will easily earn another million usd per quarter once funded accounts reach and customer deposits reach billion usd this is around billion usd higher than q figures you will be able to note that i have tweaked down the funds per funded account to be more conservative if i were to use usd per funded accounts the customer funds could easily go up to around billion usd which is another billion usd considering that the commission is driven by trading turns and the amount of customer deposits this is good for the business furthermore it is clearcut that the interest income will go up too which could potentially reach million usd per quarter going into assuming self clearing is completed by q the revenue from selfclearing fees could potentially reach million usd per quarter commissions based on my assumptions could reach million usd which i try to mange down the assumptions by assuming less trades made by per customer deposit Ôºàusd note that i did not use the same trading turn per customer deposit usd and instead use the q trading turn q¬† commissions million usd financing services fee million usd interest income million usd other revenues million usd assume unchanged settlement and clearing fees of million usd in total this works out to million usd of quarterly revenue which is reasonably conservative based on my assumptions should management achieved funded accounts and billion usd of funds in the accounts tweaking up the profit margin to instead of now the profit per quarter could easily reach million usd which then translated to around million usd of profit for note that this is before taking into account any funded accounts acquired in which is highly unlikely considering that tiger brokers is in a high growth sector fintech and wealth management platform with a growing tiger community the current valuation based on current share price of around billion usd market market would imply a next year pe ratio of only ¬† to me this is a good time to acquire a good business in a growth sector noting that the companys management has delivered the results so far and had not failed me in q i will continue to monitor its performance and keep my holdings in tiger brokers shares¬† note the risk here is if market collapses and never recovers but it is human beings character to always pick themselves up after falling down so i do not have any concerns that there will be no trading in the long run once a sizable funded accounts have been acquired even if market collapse for years typical market bear lasts months there will still be businesses for a growing company this is not forgetting that there are other wealth management products like funds that users can switch to during times of uncertainty note that trade republic an european trading platform with only billion usd of customer deposits has an implied market valuation of billion usd see the following link for your information as always the above should not be construed as any investment or trading advice note that forecasts are difficult to make and no one can claim accuracy as the forecasts are only as good as its assumptions as such i do not want to go beyond year to forecast market conditions for tiger brokers my short writeup to summarise my thoughts on tiger brokers
